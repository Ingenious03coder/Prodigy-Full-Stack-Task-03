    <div class="container">
        <p>Pickles, known as 'achar' in Hindi, have a long and rich history in India. They have been a staple of Indian cuisine for centuries, dating back to ancient times. The tradition of pickling in India is as diverse as its culture and geography.</p>

        <p>Ancient Indian texts, such as the Ayurveda, mention the preservation of vegetables and fruits through pickling methods. Pickling was not only a way to preserve food but also a means of enhancing flavors and adding medicinal properties to the ingredients.</p>

        <p>Each region of India has its own unique style of pickling, using locally available ingredients and spices. Mangoes, lemons, mixed vegetables, and even meat are commonly pickled in various parts of the country.</p>

        <p>The process of pickling involves marinating the main ingredient with a mixture of spices, oil, and sometimes vinegar or lemon juice. The combination of spices varies depending on the regional preferences and family recipes.</p>

        <p>Traditionally, pickles were prepared at home in large quantities during the summer months when fruits and vegetables were abundant. Homemade pickles were stored in ceramic or glass jars and allowed to mature over time, developing complex flavors.</p>

        <p>In modern times, pickles are not only a part of everyday meals but also hold cultural significance. They are often served as accompaniments to rice, bread, and various dishes, adding a burst of flavor and texture to the meal.</p>
